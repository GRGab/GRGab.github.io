# Gabriel Goren

My name is Gabriel Goren. I am a Mathematics PhD student at [Universidad de Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/) / [CONICET](www.conicet.gob.ar) under the supervision of [Santiago Figueira](https://glyc.dc.uba.ar/santiago/).

I am interested in applying Category Theory and Logic to the study of complex, interconnected systems.

Some topics that have interested me in the past (and still do!) are: algorithmic information theory, causal networks, inference of state machines from time series data (e.g. Crutchfield et al.'s causal states framework).
