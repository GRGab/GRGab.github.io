# Gabriel Goren Roig

My name is Gabriel Goren Roig. I am a Mathematics PhD student at [Universidad de Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/) / [CONICET](www.conicet.gob.ar) under the supervision of [Santiago Figueira](https://glyc.dc.uba.ar/santiago/).

A physicist by training, I am interested in applying Category Theory and Logic to the study of the relationship between systems and their constituents.
<!-- in particular with respect to coarse-graining and change of scale. -->

My current research projects are somewhat database-flavored. I am working on an application of the Comonadic Semantics formalism for Finite Model Theory to the study of something called _data-aware logics_. I am also working on developing algorithms for performing certain categorical constructions in the context of Categorical Database Theory.

Here are some topics that I like and on which I have worked in the past: algorithmic information theory, causal networks and causal discovery, Crutchfield et al.'s predictive states framework for inference of state machines from time series data.

## Upcoming
- In preparation: S. Figueira, G. Goren Roig, _Path Predicate Modal Logic and its Comonadic Semantics_

### 2021

- Participated in the [Adjoint School 2021](https://adjointschool.com/2021.html). During the Research Week, took part in the Extensions of Coalgebraic Dynamic Logic group under the mentoring of Helle Hvid Hansen and Clemens Kupke. As culmination of the Research Week, gave a talk at the [ACT 2021 Conference](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021/) together with [Amin Karamlou](https://aminkaramlou.github.io/) titled *Stochastic game logic, coalgebraically*.

- Defended my Licentiate Thesis, _Inferencia causal mediante correlación
sintáctica_ ([Thesis](assets/Goren_Gabriel_Tesis_Lic.pdf)) ([Slides](assets/Defensa_de_Tesis_Lic_Gabriel_Goren.pdf)) (in Spanish) conducted under the supervision of Ariel Bendersky and [Santiago Figueira](https://glyc.dc.uba.ar/santiago/).
- Received a national grant from [CONICET](www.conicet.gob.ar) to pursue a PhD.
